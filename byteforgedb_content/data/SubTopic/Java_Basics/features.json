These include:\n\n- **Platform Independent**: Thanks to the JVM, Java code runs on any machine with the JVM.\n- **Object-Oriented**: Java uses objects to combine data and actions, making it easier to manage large programs.\n- **Simple and Familiar**: Java’s syntax is similar to C/C++ but without the dangerous parts.\n- **Secure**: Java runs in a 'sandbox' to prevent malicious code from harming the host system."
