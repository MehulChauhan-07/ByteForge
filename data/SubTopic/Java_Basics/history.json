There’s Windows, Mac, IBM, Sun Microsystems machines — but the problem is: **Every machine speaks a different language!**\n\nDevelopers were stuck rewriting applications for each system. The solution? A programming language that could run anywhere. Enter Java."

They soon realized that they needed a new kind of programming language that would be portable, reliable, and small enough for small devices. This led to the birth of Java in 1995, named after the coffee that the team drank while developing it."
